# Simplified Dinosaur Game

This project is a simplified version of the classic Google Chrome Dinosaur Game, built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**. The player controls a dinosaur that runs across the screen, and the goal is to jump over obstacles to avoid collisions and survive as long as possible.

## Overview

This project was designed as one of my first ever projects for a **Web Development class** back in 2020, and helped me understand the basics of event handling, and game logic in JavaScript, aswell as an initial notion of object oriented programming.

## Features

- **Dinosaur Animation**: The dinosaur runs continuously on the screen.
- **Jumping Mechanism**: The dinosaur can jump to avoid obstacles.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the dinosaur hits a cactus.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks how long the dinosaur survives (basic score implementation).

## Running the Game
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
The game will start automatically, and you can use the spacebar or up arrow key to jump.
Avoid hitting the cacti to continue playing and increase your score!
